- nub game
- I never thought a game so bad could be made. I was wrong!
- Do not play this!
- pay to win
- terrible
- Worst game I have ever played
- The game is great, but I can't recommend it
- Shitty graphics
- buggy game
- even worse than I expected
- I have played a lot of bad games in my life but none were so offensively bad that I felt like the creator was mocking me for owning it
- I got this game for free and I still feel like I paid too much for it
- I have no idea what I am even playing
- Seriously as bad as other reviewers are saying
- poor netcode
- no players online
